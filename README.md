# GreenGuru

GreenGuru is a web app designed for seedling classification and weed detection, based on [V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset) from Kaggle. Using computer vision models, it accurately identifies 12 types of seedlings, including:

**Crop seedlings:**
- Sugar beet
- Common wheat
- Maize
  
**Weeds:**
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherd's Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill

This app ensures efficient predictions and reliable results to support agriculture and plant management.

## üìë Prerequisites

- **GreenGuru-FlaskApp**: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cQZYiSjab9FcEUCnW63_H2AJ-oCo4jF_?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR36v4yoOgB6I2IWXBzTXhhcaGIpfSH818gCuD6zJCImKL4PvM3ov67K5ZY_aem_X8GU9F1lTc6E6r3HsbbGRg#scrollTo=VjPNKzsYol4G)
- **Ngrok Account**: [Ngrok Website](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/)

---

## üî• Features

- Detect parasitic herbs and plant seedlings using machine learning.
- Simple and intuitive interface for plant management.

---

## üì• Download Models

Before running the GreenGuru-FlaskApp in Google Colab, you need to download the required models and upload them to the Colab environment.

1. **GreenGuru Model**  
   - **File:** `GreenGuruPT.pth`  
   - **Description:** Contains model architecture, weights, and the state dictionary used for plant classification.  
   - [Download GreenGuruPT.pth](https://files.fm/u/ufmgq5hk2x)

2. **EDSR Model**  
   - **File:** `EDSR_x3.pb`  
   - **Description:** Model architecture and weights for enhancing image quality and resolution.  
   - [Download EDSR](https://files.fm/u/qpndx67qm7)

### How to Use

1. Download the files using the links above.
2. Upload the downloaded files to your Google Colab workspace.
3. Ensure the files are in the same directory as the notebook to avoid errors during execution.
4. Ensure the model paths for both `GreenGuruPT.pth` and `EDSR_x3.pb` **are correctly specified in the code**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Create an Ngrok Account

**Ngrok** is used to create a tunnel, connecting the Flask app (running in Google Colab) to the GreenGuru user interface.

1. Visit the [Ngrok Website](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign up for an account.
2. Go to your dashboard and locate your **Authtoken** under the "Auth" section.
3. Copy the **Authtoken** for later use.

### 2. Setup GreenGuru-FlaskApp

#### 2.1 Open the GreenGuru-FlaskApp

- Open the [GreenGuru-FlaskApp](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cQZYiSjab9FcEUCnW63_H2AJ-oCo4jF_?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR36v4yoOgB6I2IWXBzTXhhcaGIpfSH818gCuD6zJCImKL4PvM3ov67K5ZY_aem_X8GU9F1lTc6E6r3HsbbGRg#scrollTo=VjPNKzsYol4G).

#### 2.2 Configure Your GreenGuru-FlaskApp

- Paste your Ngrok **Authtoken** in the designated code section of the notebook.

#### 2.3 Run the GreenGuru-FlaskApp

1. Run the initial part of the notebook.
2. Once executed, an Ngrok URL will be generated (e.g., `https://xyz.ngrok-free.app`). This URL connects your Flask server to the internet.

![NgrokLink](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2804e158-f256-4244-afed-f4c0e69fd54b)

3. Alternatively, check the running Ngrok Agent on the [Ngrok Agents](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/agents).

### 3. Setup GreenGuru GUI

#### 3.1 Open the GreenGuru GUI

- Open the [GreenGuru GUI](https://green-guru.vercel.app/).

![GreenGuruDashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307f6a4f-9508-4e0d-b9bf-11b8528e6dec)

#### 3.2 Enter Details

- Paste the **Ngrok URL** from the previous step into the input field.

![GreenGuruColabConnect](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/251d6a2f-e89f-499d-aa3d-e52bda2a5fb2)

### 4. Run the App

- Click **"Connect"** to start classifying plants.
- Upload plant pictures to get real-time classifications.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Flask App Down:** If the Flask app is not running, restart the GreenGuru-FlaskApp in Google Colab (refer to Step 2).
- **Notebook Crashes:** If the Google Colab notebook crashes, refresh the page and rerun the cell.
